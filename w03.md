## W03 - Top 10 Links

1. [The Linux Directory Structure, Explained](https://www.howtogeek.com/117435/htg-explains-the-linux-directory-structure-explained/) <br>
This link explained about some of the directories on Linux and what their purpose are. For example, the root ("/") directory. At first, I thought that it's just similar to Windows "C:\" directory, but it turned out quite different as he said: "While another partition would be located at D:\ on Windows, this other partition would appear in another folder under / on Linux." He also explained other directories such as "/bin", "/lib", "/mnt", etc. I feel like this link is quite useful to understand more about the structure of file systems on Linux. <br>

2. [Mounting in Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ITr5ZpzvA&ab_channel=TheLinuxMan) <br>
So before i read about what "/mnt" file is and that's a thing called mounting. I searched about that and i found this video explaining about mounting. He explained that we have to 'mount' like harddisk partition, DVD, USB drives, etc. before we actually used it. I think his way of explaining this is really clear. He also gave a example of the "mount" command and explained it thoroughly so that we really understand how to do it. <br>

3. [What's a tarball?](http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/FAQ/whats-tarball-or-how-do-i-unpack-or-create-tgz-or-targz-file) <br>
The assignment we got this week have something called "tarball". I found this forum explaining what a tarball is and essentialy it just means that files are packed into something called a tar file, which then compressed with "gzip" (other link below will explain about this). The person who answered in this forum also gave a quick explanation about how to unpack a .tar.gz file. <br>

4. [What is a TAR file? (Linux Server Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euub2EAt8jQ&ab_channel=CodyRayMiller) <br>
After the forum i found before, i also found this video with a really concise explanation about what tar file is. He then tell about how tarball usually looked like, which is a ".tar" file extension with 2 type of compression which is gzip (".tar.gz") or bzip2 (".tar.bz2"). I like that he gave an example about how to unpack a ".tar.bz2" (tar file with bzip2 compression), which is just about right since the forum before gave an example on how to unpack a tar file with gzip compression. <br>

5. [What is partitioning?](https://geek-university.com/linux/what-is-partitioning/) <br>
This website has a quick explanation about what partitioning is. Basically it's the process of dividing a disk into logical areas that can be worked with separately. They also gave several reasons upon why we may want to consider to use partitioning. <br>

6. [Virtual File System](http://openstorage.gunadarma.ac.id/linux/docs/v06/Kuliah/SistemOperasi/BUKU/SistemOperasi-4.X-2/ch16s05.html) <br>
Didn't expect to find a website explaining about this topic in Bahasa Indonesia, but here it is. So what i read from this website is that the idea of Virtual File System (VFS) is kinda like an interface between the kernel and the file system. That is for every system call (e.g. read(), write(), open(), etc.), kernel will distributed it to the actual function each of this file system had depending on their type. And the thing I love the most is that it actually just an implementation of object oriented concept (here we go again!). Definitely check it out to learn more. <br>

7. [Remote File System (RFS) in File Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-file-system-rfs-in-file-management/) <br>
Files can be shared across the network via variety of methods, and one of which is Remote File System (RFS). This geeksforgeeks' article explained the general idea about what RFS is. RFS enables file and/or data access to multiple remote users over the Internet or a network connection. It is also known as a general process of providing remote user access to locally stored files and/or data. <br>

8. [The magic behind configure, make, make install](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-magic-behind-configure-make-make-install) <br>
I tried Week03 Demos and it mentioned some command, one of them being "./configure" and "make". I wanted to know what they actually do so i went into this article. His explanation is super great and so easy to understand. Basically the configure script is responsible for getting ready to build the software on your specific system. It makes sure all of the dependencies for the rest of the build and install process are available, and finds out whatever it needs to know to use those dependencies. Once configure has done its job, we can invoke make to build the software. <br>

9. [The Quick Guide to GUIDs](https://betterexplained.com/articles/the-quick-guide-to-guids/) <br>
What is a GUID? GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifier) are large, enormous numbers that are nearly guaranteed to be unique. They are usually 128 bits long and look like this in hexadecimal: 30dd879c-ee2f-11db-8314-0800200c9a66. This article doesn't just explained what is GUID, but also explained why we won't run out of GUID (spoiler: not in a billion years! -literally), how to create GUID, and some benefits and drawbacks that GUID has. <br>

10. [What is Network File System (NFS) File Share?](https://www.datto.com/blog/what-is-nfs-file-share) <br>
NFS, or Network File System, is a collaboration system developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 80s that allows users to view, store, update or share files on a remote computer as though it was a local computer. This article explained the benefits of NFS and also the basics of getting NFS running on your network. In addition, it also explained other files sharing option such as Common Internet File System (CIFS). <br>
