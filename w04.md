## W04 - Top 10 Links

1. [Computer Storage Structure: Base and Limit Register](https://notesformsc.org/computer-system-structure/) <br>
One of the concern when CPU is accessing the memory address is the protection. I found this article explaining that to protect memory we use two registers – base register and limit register. The way it works is that a program can only access address from adress number base register to address number base+limit register (so only in a certain range). Therefore, if the user application tries to access operating system memory address the OS trap is generated. It's really cool and not only that, this article also contains some general explanation about how computer system operation works with more example and really great graph and figures so it's easier to understand. <br>

2. [An introduction to swap space on Linux systems](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/swap-space-linux-systems) <br>
Imagine working on something and suddenly you notice that your RAM is already full, now what should you do? Don't worry, because there is a another type of memory in modern Linux systems called swap space. The primary function of swap space is to substitute disk space for RAM memory when real RAM fills up and more space is needed. The kernel uses a memory management program that detects blocks, aka pages, of memory in which the contents have not been used recently. The memory management program swaps enough of these relatively infrequently used pages of memory out to a special partition on the hard drive specifically designated for “paging,” or swapping. All of this frees up RAM and makes room for more things to do. <br> 

3. [Memory Management in OS: Contiguous, Swapping, Fragmentation](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html) <br>
Memory Management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning portions known as blocks to various running programs to optimize the overall performance of the system. I think this article is good because it's not only explain what memory management is along with why it's use and its different techniques, but it also covers about what is paging, fragmentation, static and dynamic loading, and a whole lot more. And on top of that, it also had a really clear and concise way of explaining all of these topics, recommended! <br>

4. [Page Table Entries in Page Table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-table-entries-in-page-table/) <br>
After reading about paging in the previous there's this thing called paging. Paging is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages. I searched it up to get more information about this, and geeksforgeeks has an article about one of the subtopic in paging which is page table and its entries. They explained what the function of each entry is with a good brief explanation. <br>

5. [Inverted Page Table in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inverted-page-table-in-operating-system/) <br>
This article is in the recommended section after reading the last one about page table. So sometimes when a process is very large in size and it occupies virtual memory then with the size of the process, it’s page table size also increases substantially. An alternate approach is to use the Inverted Page Table structure that consists of one-page table entry for every frame of the main memory. This article explained much more thoruoghly so definitely check it out. <br>

6. [What is the Difference Between Big Endian and Little Endian?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBA6svOyWb8&ab_channel=EyeonTech) <br>
As the title suggests, this video explains the difference between big endian and little endian. She gives the example of both of them and also explained the pros of using big or little endian. It's a really quick video (only 2 minutes) and her explanation is quite clear so i really like it. <br>

7. [Difference between Static and Shared libraries](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-static-and-shared-libraries) <br>
There are two types of library in Linux which is static and shared library. According to this article, static library is the library in which all the code to execute the file is in one executable file and this file get copied into a target application by a compiler, linker, or binder, producing an object file and a stand-alone executable. Meanwhile, shared library is the library in which only the address of library is mentioned in the target program while all the functions and code of library are in a special place in memory space, and every program can access them, without having multiple copies of them. This web mentions more differences between them in a nice table figure, which i think make it easier to understand. <br>

8. [C Pointers](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers) <br>
This web gives some tutorials about pointers in C, starting from declaring the pointers, assigning address, get its value, etc. I like it because i think the example is simple and their explanation is quite easy to follow. <br>

9. [C Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-dynamic-memory-allocation) <br>
Once an array is declared, usually we cannot change the size of that array. But sometimes afterwards we realized that the size is either too big or too small. Fortunately in C, this issue can be resolved by dynamic memory allocation with the library functions: malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free(). In this tutorial, they talk briefly about how to use four of those methods and also gave a quite thorough explanation on the basic syntax of these methods. <br>

10. [What is a Makefile and how does it work?](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) <br>
So when i tried the demos both on last week and this week, i didn't knew what the function of the "Makefile" file is. Apparently according to this article, the "make" command requires a file, which is indeed, the "Makefile", which defines set of tasks to be executed. This article also goes to explain with some more examples and i think it's really helpful. <br>
