## W05 - Top 10 Links

1. [Virtual Memory by Alexander S. Gillis](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory) <br>
This article explained what Virtual Memory is in general like how it works and how to manage it, the types, the benefit of using virtual memory, and many more. I think this article is great because the explanation is quite easy to follow, but it also goes quite in-depth like the history and the limitation of virtual memory. <br>

2. [What is Demand Paging?](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html) <br>
One of the section in this web explained what demand paging is, and apparently it's similar to the swapping paging system. It's really interesting, check it out to learn more! <br>

3. [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/) <br>
In case of page fault, Operating System might have to replace one of the existing pages with the newly needed page and different algorithms gives different ways to decide which page to replace. This geeksforgeeks article explains some page replacement algorithms and also provides example of each one of them. <br>

4. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/) <br>
Explained what allocation of frame is and its several types. I like that they also give the adavantages and disadvantages of every types. <br>

5. [How to Use the Linux Top command](https://vitux.com/how-to-use-the-ubuntu-linux-top-command/) <br>
This is the command that we used in this week's demo. This web explained a bit about how to use it in general along with some commands example. <br>

6. [Thrashing in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/thrashing-in-operating-system) <br>
In case, if the page fault and swapping happens very frequently at a higher rate, then the operating system has to spend more time swapping these pages. This state in the operating system is termed thrashing. Read more in this website to learn more about thrasing, its causes, effects, and the techniques used to handle the thrashing. <br>

7. [Allocating kernel memory (buddy system and slab system)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/) <br>
There are two strategis to for managing free memory that is assigned to kernel processes which is Buddy System and Slab System. In this article, they explained what is it in general, why to use, advantages, and drawbacks of both of them. <br>

8. [5 commands to check memory usage on Linux](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-command-check-memory-usage/) <br>
Besides using the top command, there is also several other command to use to see memory usage in Linux. This website gives simple example on using those commands. <br>

9. [Shared Memory](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13279/shared-memory) <br>
This website gives explanation about what shared memory is in general. I think it's easy to understand and it's also quite short. They also gave an example on how shared memory works. <br>

10. [What is Kernel Panic?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/35722/what-is-kernel-panic) <br>
This is a forum answering to a question about what kernel panic is, why does it occurs, how to find it out, etc. I like that the answer is clear and concise -and apparently the blue screen of death of Windows is also one of the example of kernel panic-. <br>
