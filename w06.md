## W06 - Top 10 Links

1. [Concurrency vs. Parallelism](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/multi-threading/concurrency-vs-parallelism/) <br>
This article explains concurrency means multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, in no specific order,  parallelism is when multiple tasks OR several part of a unique task literally run at the same time, e.g. on a multi-core processor. Definitely check it out to learn more about the difference between them. <br>

2. [Process in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes) <br>
A process is a program in execution which then forms the basis of all computation. This web gives explanation about process memory, the different types of process states such as NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, and TERMINATED, and process control block. It also provides information about the difference between process and program. I think it's great because it's quite concise and easy to understand. <br>

3. [Process Control Block in Operating System](https://afteracademy.com/blog/process-control-block-in-operating-system) <br>
More about process control block, this blog describes what process control block is. There are also various attributes of a PCB that helps the CPU to execute a particular process. To name a few: Process ID (a unique identity of a process), Program Counter (points to the next instruction that is to be executed by the CPU), Process State and Priority that associated with each process. Go to the blog to read more each of them and other attributes of a PCB. <br>

4. [Process Creation vs Process Termination in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system) <br>
Process Creation and Process termination are used to create and terminate processes respectively. In this article, they explained the general about how process creation and process termination works in general. <br>

5. [Multithreading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/multithreading-in-c) <br>
Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking and a multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. In general, there are two types of multitasking: process-based and thread-based. This article explained about multithreading in C. <br>

6. [Multithreading Models in Operating System](https://binaryterms.com/multithreading-models-in-operating-system.html#:~:text=Many%20to%20One%20multithreading%20model,equal%20number%20of%20kernel%20threads.) <br>
This web explains about a few multithreading models, which is Many to One model, One to One model and Many to Many model. It also gives explanation about threads that are implemented at the user level (user-level thread) and at the kernel level (kernel-level threads). <br>

7. [Threading Issues in OS](https://binaryterms.com/threading-issues-in-os.html) <br>
There are several threading issues when we are in a multithreading environment. In this web, they explained some of the threading issues: system calls, cancellation of thread, signal handling, thread pool and thread-specific data. <br>

8. [Message Passing vs Shared Memory Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/message-passing-vs-shared-memory-process-communication-models) <br>
Message passing model and shared memory model are models of interprocess communication. Message passing model allows multiple processes to read and write data to the message queue without being connected to each other while the shared memory in the shared memory model is the memory that can be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes. Find out about those more on this web. <br>

9. [What is Context Switching in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system) <br>
A context switching is a process that involves switching of the CPU from one process or task to another. In this phenomenon, the execution of the process that is present in the running state is suspended by the kernel and another process that is present in the ready state is executed by the CPU. In this web they explained about what context switching is and also the advantages and disadvantes about it. <br>

10. [Fork() in C Programming Language](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/) <br>
This web explain about how fork works in general. The operating system is using a unique id for every process to keep track of all processes. And for that, fork() doesnâ€™t take any parameter and return an int value: Zero, Positive value, or Negative value. <br>
