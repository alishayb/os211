## W07 - Top 10 Links

1. [Process Synchronization: Critical Section Problem in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/) <br>
A critical section is a segment of code which can be accessed by a signal process at a specific point of time. This article give general explanation about what critical section is. It also explained the rules and different solutions on critical section. <br>

2. [Race Condition](https://techterms.com/definition/race_condition) <br>
Most software programs are multithreaded, meaning they can process several threads at once. If a program relies on threads that run in an unpredictable sequence, a race condition may occur. This web example the general definition of what race condition is along with example that I think is quite easy to follow. <br>

3. [Introduction to Semaphores](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/introduction-to-semaphores) <br>
Semaphore is a variable that can hold only a non-negative Integer value, shared between all the threads, with operations wait and signal. Check it out to learn more about the definition of wait and signal and the two types of semaphore: binary and counting semaphore, plus the advantages and disadvantages of semaphore. <br>

4. [Chmod Command in Linux (File Permissions)](https://linuxize.com/post/chmod-command-in-linux/) <br>
For this week assignment, we used one of the command in Linux which is chmod. The chmod command allows you to change the permissions on a file using either a symbolic or numeric mode or a reference file. In this web, they explained how to use chmod with both symbolic (text) method or the numeric method along with some examples of it. It's helping me understand this week assignment more. <br>

5. [Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/) <br>
Peterson’s Solution is a classical software based solution to the critical section problem using two variables, a bool array flag of size 2 and an int variable turn to accomplish it. Read more on the link for more thorough explanation about the Peterson’s algorithm along with some example. <br>
 
6. [Introduction to DEADLOCK in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html) <br>
Deadlock is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource. In this web, they explained what deadlock is and the example of deadlock. They also provides the advantages and disadvantages of deadlock, and also explanation about Deadlock Detection, Prevention, and Avoidance. <br>

7. [Difference between Mutex and Semaphore in Operating System](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-mutex-and-semaphore-in-operating-system) <br>
Mutex and Semaphore both provide synchronization services but they are not the same, so what is the different between them? This article gives a few point that I think is quite clear and concise on what is the difference between Mutex and Semaphore, and also gives general explanation on both of them. <br>

8. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer) <br>
Bounded buffer problem, which is also called producer consumer problem, is one of the problems of synchronization, consist of two process running, namely, producer and consumer. A producer tries to insert data into an empty slot of the buffer while a consumer tries to remove data from a filled slot in the buffer. Check this web for more thorough explanation on whar bounded buffer problem is and what is the solution upon that. <br>

9. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/readers-writers-problem) <br>
The readers-writers problem relates to an object such as a file that is shared between multiple processes. Some of these processes are readers i.e. they only want to read the data from the object and some of the processes are writers i.e. they want to write into the object. I think their explanation is quite easy to understand and they also goes to explain how the solution works with a simple examples. <br>

10. [Dining Philosophers Problem (DPP)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dining-philosophers-problem-dpp) <br>
The dining philosopher is one of the problem of synchronization. Imagine that there are 5 philosophers sharing a circular table and they eat and think alternatively. There is a bowl of rice for each of the philosophers and 5 chopsticks. A philosopher needs both their right and left chopstick to eat. A hungry philosopher may only eat if there are both chopsticks available. Otherwise a philosopher puts down their chopstick and begin thinking again. This article gives general idea about what dining philosopher problem is along with the solution to solve it. <br>
