## W08 - Top 10 Links

1. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling: Key Differences](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html) <br>
Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling method where the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities, while in Non-Preemptive Scheduling, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. This web explain the general idea about what preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling is and some points of difference between them. It also provides information about the advantages and disadvantages plus the example for each of them. <br>

2. [Process Scheduling: Long, Medium, Short Term Scheduler](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html) <br>
Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states like ready, waiting, and running. I think this web gives a thorough information on process scheduling from the definiton of process scheduling, scheduling objectives, type of process schedulers: Long Term (also known as a job scheduler), Short Term (also known as CPU scheduler), and Medium Term ( also called swapping scheduler.), and also the differences between schedulers. <br>

3. [First Come First Serve Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/first-come-first-serve) <br>
In the "First come first serve" scheduling algorithm, as the name suggests, the process which arrives first, gets executed first, or we can say that the process which requests the CPU first, gets the CPU allocated first. In this article, they explained what First Come First Serve is and the problems with it and one of them being the 'Convoy Effect'. They also explained what Convoy Effect is and also a program example using of FCFS algorithm. <br>

4. [Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-sjf-scheduling) <br>
This web explained briefly about Shortest Job First Scheduling. In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, among the list of available processes in the ready queue, is going to be scheduled next. They also gives the advantages and disadvantages of SJF scheduling and an example of how SJF scheduling works. <br>

5. [Round Robin Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/) <br>
Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. He explained about advantages and disadvantages using Round Robin and how to computes completion time, turn around time, and waiting time in Round Robin using a program. <br>

6. [Multilevel Queue Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-queue-mlq-cpu-scheduling/) <br> 
Processes in the ready queue can be divided into different classes where each class has its own scheduling needs, for example, a common division is a foreground (interactive) process and background (batch) processes. For this kind of situation Multilevel Queue Scheduling is used. This site explained Multilevel Queue Scheduling in general along with some illustration to help understand it easier. <br>

7. [User-level threads and Kernel-level threads](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/user-level-threads-and-kernel-level-threads) <br>
There are two main types of threads which is user-level threads and kernel-level threads. The user-level threads are implemented by users and the kernel is not aware of the existence of these threads. Meanwhile, kernel-level threads are handled by the operating system directly and the thread management is done by the kernel. This article explained general idea and also advantages and disadvantages for each of them. <br>

8. [Rate Monotonic Scheduling Algorithm](https://microcontrollerslab.com/rate-monotonic-scheduling-algorithm/) <br>
The Rate Monotonic Scheduling Algorithm is a simple rule that assigns priorities to different tasks according to their time period. That is task with smallest time period will have highest priority and a task with longest time period will have lowest priority for execution. In this web, they explained about Rate Monotonic Scheduling in general with an example of it. <br>

9. [Difference Between Hard Real Time System and Soft Real Time System](https://vivadifferences.com/10-difference-between-hard-real-time-system-and-soft-real-time-system/) <br>
A hard real-time system is an operating system that must operate within a stringent predefined deadline while a soft real-time system is an operating system in which a critical real-time task gets priority over other task and retains that priority over other tasks until it completes. I think this site explained quite clear and concise about the differences between hard real time system and soft real time system while also gives many examples for both of them. <br>

10. [What is Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Response time, Waiting time, Turnaround time, and Throughput?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-burst-arrival-exit-response-waiting-turnaround-time-and-throughput) <br>
As the title said, this article explained what is Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Response time, Waiting time, Turnaround time, and Throughput. I think the article is quite easy to understand while also gives some simple example for each of them. <br>
